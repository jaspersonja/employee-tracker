# Employee Tracker

## Description
My goal for this project was to create a working employee tracker that would allow the user to view, create and modify employee info in a database. In this project I learned how to create and link databases and how to have the data be used and stored using MYSQL. 



## Installation
Before starting the user must navigate to the employee-tracker file in the terminal and use "npm i" to install all packages. 

## Usage
Once the user has run "npm i" in the terminal they may then proceed to enter "npm start" into the command line to fire up the application and follow the prompts given to navigate and use the program as desired.
